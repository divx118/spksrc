This needs to be run outside the spkrc docker image. 
Usage example: php CodeSign.php  --keydir=~/.gnupg --sign=packages/iperf_northstarplus-1.2_3.1.3-.spk
On dsm there is no gpg-agent so I installed the gnupg package for my NAS (build with spkrc)..
Further info about signing can be found https://originhelp.synology.com/developer-guide/create_package/sign_package.html
The CodeSign.php I got from https://github.com/SynologyOpenSource/pkgscripts-ng/blob/master/CodeSign.php
